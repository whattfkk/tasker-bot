i wrote it in two days, don't judge me too harshly

for start:
- launch `pip install -r requirements.txt` for dependencies
- launch users.py for users db
- launch api from tasker-api
- change api url in config
- change bot token in config (botfather can help you with it)
- launch main.py for bot starting
